# From Algorithms to Z-Scores: Probability and Statistics in Computer Science (in Python)

## Purpose

[Link to the Book](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/PLN/ProbStatBook.pdf)

It's a great time to keep learning -- many thanks to the author of
this book, Norm Matloff, for kindly open-sourced some of their learning
materials; professors like him have truly made learning more accessible to
many. However, even though material can be easily accessed, the process of
learning (especially when one does not have access to an expert) can still be
daunting.  Teaching oneself could be really hard, and I'd like to improve the
learning process for others in the same boat as I am.  Feel free to file a
Github issue if you dispute an answer or find any mistakes.

Happy learning!
