# From Algorithms to Z-Scores: Probability and Statistics in Computer Science (in Python)

## Purpose

It's a great time to keep learning -- many thanks to professors who put have
kindly open-sourced some of their learning materials (such as the author of
this book, Norm Matloff); they have truly made learning more accessible to
many. However, even though material can be easily accessed, the process of
learning (especially when one does not have access to an expert) can still be
daunting. To help others with the learning process, I am sharing my own
personal solutions. Answers are my own, and may have mistakes.  Feel free to
file a Github issue if you dispute an answer or find any mistakes.
